BigPix embedded software

This is the place where you can download BigPix ESP software and also contribute to its development.

BigPix is a flying RC model stuffed with a matix of LEDs to display images in the night sky. The LED
control is achieved by an on-board ESP computer, which also opens a WiFi acces point with a webpage 
allowing the spectators to choose the actual image displayed.
